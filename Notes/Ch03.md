## Quiz
* State mathematically what we mean when we say that there exists a linear relationship between two Random Variables.
    * $Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$
    * We say that we are (linearly) regressing $Y$ on(to) $X$.
* If we have $Y \approx \beta_0 + \beta_1 X$ then what do we call:
    * $\approx$ - Approximately modelled as
    * $\beta_0$ - intercept
    * $\beta_1$ - slope
*

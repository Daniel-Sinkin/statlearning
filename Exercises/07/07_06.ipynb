    "In this exercise, you will further analyze the `Wage` data set considered throughout this chapter.\n",
    "1. Perform polynomial regression to predict wage using age. Use cross-validation to select the optimal degree d for the polynomial. What degree was chosen, and how does this compare to the results of hypothesis testing using ANOVA? Make a plot of the resulting polynomial fit to the data.\n",
    "2. Fit a step function to predict wage using age, and perform crossvalidation to choose the optimal number of cuts. Make a plot of the fit obtained."

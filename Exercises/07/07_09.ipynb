    "# Question 9\n",
    "This question uses the variables `dis` (the weighted mean of distances to five Boston employment centers) and `nox` (nitrogen oxides concentration in parts per 10 million) from the `Boston` data. We will treat dis as the predictor and `nox` as the response.\n",
    "1. Use the `poly()` function from the `ISLP.models` module to fit a cubic polynomial regression to predict `nox` using `dis`. Report the regression output, and plot the resulting data and polynomial fits.\n",
    "2. Plot the polynomial fits for a range of different polynomial degrees (say, from 1 to 10), and report the associated residual sum of squares.\n",
    "3. Perform cross-validation or another approach to select the optimal degree for the polynomial, and explain your results.\n",
    "4. Use the `bs()` function from the `ISLP.models` module to fit a regression spline to predict `nox` using `dis`. Report the output for the fit using four degrees of freedom. How did you choose the knots? Plot the resulting fit.\n",
    "5. Now fit a regression spline for a range of degrees of freedom, and plot the resulting fits and report the resulting RSS. Describe the results obtained.\n",
    "6. Perform cross-validation or another approach in order to select the best degrees of freedom for a regression spline on this data. Describe your results."

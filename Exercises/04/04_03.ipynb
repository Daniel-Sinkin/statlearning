    "#### 3. This problem relates to the $\\operatorname{QDA}$ model, in which the observations within each class are drawn from a normal distribution with a classspecific mean vector and a class specific covariance matrix. We consider the simple case where $p = 1$; i.e. there is only one feature. Suppose that we have K classes, and that if an observation belongs to the kth class then $X$ comes from a one-dimensional normal distribution, $X âˆ¼ N(\\mu_k, \\sigma_k^2 )$. Recall that the density function for the one-dimensional normal distribution is given in (4.16). Prove that in this case, the Bayes classifier is not linear. Argue that it is in fact quadratic. Hint: For this problem, you should follow the arguments laid out in Section 4.4.1, but without making the assumption that $\\sigma_1^2 = \\sigma_2^2 = \\dots = \\sigma_K^2$."

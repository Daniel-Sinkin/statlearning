    "# Question 10\n",
    "We have seen that as the number of features used in a model increases, the training error will necessarily decrease, but the test error may not. We will now explore this in a simulated data set.\n",
    "1. Generate a data set with $p = 20$ features, $n = 1000$ observations, and an associated quantitative response vector generated according to the model $Y = X \\beta + \\varepsilon$, where $\\beta$ has some elements that are exactly equal to zero.\n",
    "2. Split your data set into a training set containing $100$ observations and a test set containing $900$ observations.\n",
    "3. Perform best subset selection on the training set, and plot the training set $\\operatorname{MSE}$ associated with the best model of each size.\n",
    "4. Plot the test set $\\operatorname{MSE}$ associated with the best model of each size.\n",
    "5. For which model size does the test set $\\operatorname{MSE}$ take on its minimum value? Comment on your results. If it takes on its minimum value for a model containing only an intercept or a model containing all of the features, then play around with the way that you are generating the data in (1) until you come up with a scenario in which the test set $\\operatorname{MSE}$ is minimized for an intermediate model size.\n",
    "6. How does the model at which the test set $\\operatorname{MSE}$ is minimized compare to the true model used to generate the data? Comment on the coefficient values.\n",
    "7. Create a plot displaying $\\sqrt{\\sum_{j = 1}^p (\\beta_j âˆ’ \\hat{\\beta}_j^r)^2}$ for a range of values of r, where $\\hat{\\beta}_j^r$ is the jth coefficient estimate for the best model containing $r$ coefficients. Comment on what you observe. How does this compare to the test $\\operatorname{MSE}$ plot from (4)?"

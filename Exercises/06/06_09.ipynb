    "# Question 9\n",
    "In this exercise, we will predict the number of applications received using the other variables in the `College` data set.\n",
    "1. Split the data set into a training set and a test set.\n",
    "2. Fit a linear model using least squares on the training set, and report the test error obtained.\n",
    "3. Fit a ridge regression model on the training set, with $\\lambda$ chosen by cross-validation. Report the test error obtained.\n",
    "4. Fit a lasso model on the training set, with $\\lambda$ chosen by crossvalidation. Report the test error obtained, along with the number of non-zero coefficient estimates.\n",
    "5. Fit a $\\operatorname{PCR}$ model on the training set, with $M$ chosen by crossvalidation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of $M$ selected by cross-validation.\n",
    "6. Fit a $\\operatorname{PLS}$ model on the training set, with $M$ chosen by crossvalidation. Report the test error obtained, along with the value of $M$ selected by cross-validation.\n",
    "7. Comment on the results obtained. How accurately can we predict the number of college applications received? Is there much difference among the test errors resulting from these five approaches?"

    "We perform best subset, forward stepwise, and backward stepwise selection on a single data set. For each approach, we obtain $p + 1$ models, containing $0, 1, 2, \\dots,  predictors. Explain your answers:\n",
    "1. Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest training RSS?\n",
    "2. Which of the three models with k predictors has the smallest test RSS?\n",
    "3. True or False:\n",
    "    1. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by forward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k+1)-variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.\n",
    "    2. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)variable model identified by backward stepwise selection.\n",
    "    3. The predictors in the k-variable model identified by backward stepwise are a subset of the predictors in the (k + 1)variable model identified by forward stepwise selection.\n",
